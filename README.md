# CogRehab_Eprime_local
This is a script that resides in the CogRehab USB-stick for transferring data from the BIC at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center.

It does the following: 
- creates a folder with the participant ID in the CogRehab_data folder on the USB stick
- copies e-prime output files (.edat3 files) for all fMRI tasks for the participant into the relavant 	folder on the USB stick
- moves all output files (.edat3 files, txt files, xml files) for all fMRI tasks for the participant 	into the data folder in CogRehab folder on the BIC computer where the Eprime data are collected.
